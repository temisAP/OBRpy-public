# OBRpy
Python library to manage LUNA's OBR-4600. Focused on distributed sensing. Both acquiring and post-processing of data.

Hi there! 

Maybe you are starting to use LUNA's OBR-4600 as I was a time ago and you are wondering if there's something like a Python library to manage all of this stuff, automate processes, and so on.
Well, I tried my best to develop some code to access .obr info and compute some other signal operations. However, there is still a long path to walk and there are some aspects that I still need to develop, so if you are interested in joining my project, send me an email to: a.pedraza@upm.es and let's see what can we do (according to your and mine licenses and entitlements).

This is a project with no commercial purposes but scientific ones. We are working on making the world a slightly better place to be and that is enough investment. :relaxed:
